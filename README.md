# advent-of-code

My solutions for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com).

## 2023

Completed: `0/25`.

The structure I plan to do.
```sh
2023/
  |__Makefile
  |__main.c
  |__aoc.h
  |__day-*/
    |__source.c
    |__test.c
    |__input_full.txt
    |__input_test.txt
```
To run my solutions:
```sh
make
./aoc2023        // run all
./aoc2023 8-full // run a specific solution
```

## 2022

Completed: `9/25`.

I made it to the day 9, and choose to discover Go with it. Pretty fun
experience.
