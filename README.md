My solutions for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com).

## 2023 - C language

Completed: `2/25`.

The structure of the project:
```sh

  |__aoc.h
  |__tests.c
  |__day-{n}/
    |__source.c

```

## 2022 - Go

I made it to the day 9, and choose to discover Go with it. Pretty fun
experience.
